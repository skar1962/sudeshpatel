									<h2>Ingredients</h2>
									<ul>
									<li>1tbsp olive oil</li> 
									<li>1 onion, chopped</li> 
									<li>500g minced lamb</li> 
									<li>1tsp cinnamon</li> 
									<li>1tsp mixed spice </li>
									<li>½tsp ground cumin </li>
									<li>100ml (3½fl oz) lamb or chicken stock</li> 
									<li>75g (3oz) dried apricots, chopped </li>
									<li>50g (2oz) pine nuts </li>
									<li>handful parsley, roughly chopped </li>
									<li>5-6 Jus-Rol Filo pastry sheets </li>
									<li>50g (2oz) butter, melted </li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Method</h2>
									Preheat the oven to gas 5, 190°C, fan 170°C. Heat the oil in a large pan and gently fry the onion until softened. Add the lamb 
									and cook until browned, breaking up any clumps with a wooden spoon. Stir in the spices, then add the stock. Continue cooking over 
									a medium heat for 15 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed. Stir the apricots through the mince and season well. Set 
									aside to cool. Meanwhile, toast the pine nuts in a dry pan and leave to cool. Stir the cooled pine nuts through the mince with 
									the parsley. To assemble the pie, put one sheet of filo pastry in a 20cm (8in) ovenproof dish and lightly brush with some of 
									the melted butter. Repeat with two more sheets, layering the dish until the base and sides are completely covered, with the 
									excess pastry hanging over the edge. Spoon the filling into the dish and fold over the excess pastry to cover. Brush with melted butter.
									Brush another filo sheet with butter and tear it into strips. Drape the strips over the filling, allowing them to fall unevenly 
									in waves. Repeat with the remaining sheet of filo and brush again with melted butter. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until crispy and golden.

									<h2>Ingredients</h2>
									Olive oil
									500g lamb neck or similar, diced
									1 onion, roughly chopped
									2 carrots, roughly chopped
									2 garlic cloves, crushed/chopped
									400g can of chickpeas (optional)
									200g dried apricots
									2 tsp ground cumin
									1 tsp paprika
									1 tsp dried coriander
									1 cinnamon stick
									1 tbsp finely chopped fresh root ginger
									250g sweet potatoes
									1 can chopped tomatoes
									200ml chicken stock
									Fresh chopped coriander (optional)
									<h2>Method</h2>
									In a large pan, heat the oil over a medium heat and brown the lamb on all sides, then transfer onto a plate. Add the onions, ginger and carrots, then fry for a few minutes until the carrots are starting to brown. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Tip the lamb back in, then stir in all the spices and cinnamon stick, and add the chopped tomatoes, apricots and chickpeas (if using). Season well.
									Bring the pan to the boil whilst stirring, then reduce to a simmer for 10 minutes or so to thicken the sauce. (You don't have to do this bit, but it will be better if you do). Transfer to the slow cooker, and cook for 6-8 hours on medium.
									Approximately two hours before you want to eat, chuck in the sweet potatoes. If you're like me and leave it on whilst at work you can leave this bit out, or you can cheat by boiling them up in a pan and throwing them in last minute. Don't be tempted to leave them in all day or you'll have orange slodge in place of your potatoes!
									Scatter with chopped coriander to serve, if you have it.
